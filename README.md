# Canvas API Recipes for Node

The Canvas API client exposes many useful "recipes" for automating tedious or otherwise impossible tasks to do via the website. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for use with your own API tokens and Canvas domains. 

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node 8.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 

### Installion

To use with node:
```bash
$ npm install node-canvas-api
```
Then, in wherever you want to use this package:
```javascript
const canvasAPI = require('node-canvas-api');
```

Attached to the `canvasAPI` are a bunch of functions.
